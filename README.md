War Card Game

This is a Python-based implementation of the classic card game War. The game follows the traditional rules where two players draw cards from a shuffled deck and compare their values. The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards. The game continues until one player has all the cards or until a pre-defined number of rounds have passed.

Game Rules
Deck Creation and Shuffling:

The deck consists of 52 cards (13 ranks: 2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace in 4 suits).
The deck is shuffled randomly at the start of the game.
Game Initialization:

The deck should be split evenly between two players (26 cards each).
Cards should be dealt face down, with players not knowing their opponentâ€™s cards.
Gameplay:

Players draw one card at a time.
The player with the higher card value wins the round and takes both cards.
In case of a tie, the player

Technical Requirements
Object-Oriented Programming: Use classes to represent the deck, cards, and players.

Card class for individual cards (with attributes like suit and rank).
Deck class for handling the deck (shuffling, dealing).
Player class for managing a player's hand and score.
Game class to handle the overall game flow (rounds, wins, and losses).
Git and GitHub: Use Git for version control. Each major feature should be committed as a separate GitHub issue and branch.

Pair Programming: You will collaborate with a peer during at least 3 pair programming sessions. At least one session will involve working on your project, and one will involve working on another person's project.
