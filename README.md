War Card Game

This is a Python-based implementation of the classic card game War. The game follows the traditional rules where two players draw cards from a shuffled deck and compare their values. The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards. The game continues until one player has all the cards or until a pre-defined number of rounds have passed.
